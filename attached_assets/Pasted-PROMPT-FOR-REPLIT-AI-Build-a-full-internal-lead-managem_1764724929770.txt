PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI

Build a full internal lead-management system with two public-facing pages (/affiliate and /get-help) and two private login portals (Admin + Affiliate).

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Create the following components:
1. Database

Use a built-in Replit DB or SQLite (your choice) with tables:

Tables needed:

users (id, name, email, password_hash, role = “admin” or “affiliate”)

affiliate_applications

help_requests

Each lead record must include:

id

data fields

lead_type

timestamp

status

assigned_to (nullable for Admin assignment)

2. Authentication System

Create two secure login portals:

Admin Portal (/admin/login)

Admins can:

view all affiliate applications

view all help requests

filter, sort, categorize, update status

assign leads to affiliates

manage users (create affiliates, reset passwords, etc.)

Affiliate Portal (/affiliate/login)

Affiliates can:

log in with their own credentials

view only the leads assigned to them

update lead status

mark leads as contacted, in progress, closed, etc.

Important:
Hash all passwords. Do NOT store plain text.
Use sessions or JWT for secure login handling.
