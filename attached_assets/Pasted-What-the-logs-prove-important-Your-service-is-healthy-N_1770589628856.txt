What the logs prove (important)

Your service is healthy:

✅ Node started
✅ DB connected
✅ Sessions initialized
✅ Seeds ran
✅ Express bound
✅ Queues running

Key line:

[express] serving on port 8080


So the app is alive.

Why Railway thinks it’s “not working”

Railway only considers a service “up” if ALL of these are true:

The process binds to the correct port

The port matches Railway’s injected PORT

The process keeps running

The service responds to HTTP traffic

You are failing #1 / #2, not #3.

The core problem (this is it)

You hard-coded port 8080.

Railway does not guarantee 8080.

Railway injects a dynamic port via:

process.env.PORT


If you bind to 8080 instead of PORT, Railway’s proxy can’t reach your app — so it looks “dead” even though it’s running.

The fix (mandatory)
🔴 BAD (what you likely have)
app.listen(8080, () => {
  console.log("serving on port 8080");
});

✅ GOOD (Railway-compatible)
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;

app.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0", () => {
  console.log(`[express] serving on port ${PORT}`);
});


Two critical things here:

Use process.env.PORT

Bind to "0.0.0.0" (Railway requires this)

Why "0.0.0.0" matters

Railway containers are networked.
Binding to localhost or default interfaces can block ingress.

Always do:

app.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0")

Second thing to check (takes 10 seconds)

In Railway → Service → Settings:

Start Command must be exactly:

npm start


or

node dist/index.cjs


Not:

npm run dev

anything interactive

anything watching files

Your logs show npm start is correct 👍

Health check (optional but recommended)

Railway doesn’t require this, but it makes life easier.

Add:

app.get("/health", (_req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send("ok");
});


Then Railway can always confirm the service is alive.

One more silent killer to rule out

If Railway immediately restarts after this log, check:

Environment Variables

Make sure all of these exist in Railway (not just locally):

DATABASE_URL

SESSION_SECRET

Any Stripe / email / queue secrets

Missing env vars can cause crash loops after startup, which sometimes look like “it never deploys”.

Why I’m confident this is the issue

Because:

Your app clearly starts

Express is running

No crash logs

Railway “can’t see it”

Port is hard-coded

That combination = PORT mismatch 99% of the time.

What I want you to do next (in order)

Change app.listen to use process.env.PORT + "0.0.0.0"

Redeploy

Watch logs for:

serving on port 3xxxx


(Railway ports are usually high numbers)

If it still fails after that, paste the first 30 lines after redeploy, and we’ll go one layer deeper (proxy / service type / region).

You’re very close — this is plumbing, not architecture.
