THE PATTERN: “Proceed Anyway + File Report”

Every optional feature panel (camera, upload, etc.) gets three states:

Available → normal UI

Unavailable / Failed → warning + actions

Acknowledged → continue, logged

1️⃣ UI COMPONENT (drop-in)

Create a single reusable component so this never becomes ad hoc.

DegradedFeatureNotice.tsx
type DegradedFeatureNoticeProps = {
  featureName: string;
  description: string;
  onProceed: () => void;
  onReport: () => void;
};

export function DegradedFeatureNotice({
  featureName,
  description,
  onProceed,
  onReport,
}: DegradedFeatureNoticeProps) {
  return (
    <div className="rounded border border-yellow-400 bg-yellow-50 p-4">
      <h3 className="font-semibold text-yellow-800">
        {featureName} Unavailable
      </h3>

      <p className="mt-1 text-sm text-yellow-700">
        {description}
      </p>

      <div className="mt-4 flex gap-3">
        <button
          onClick={onProceed}
          className="rounded bg-yellow-600 px-3 py-1.5 text-white hover:bg-yellow-700"
        >
          Proceed Anyway
        </button>

        <button
          onClick={onReport}
          className="rounded border border-yellow-600 px-3 py-1.5 text-yellow-700 hover:bg-yellow-100"
        >
          Proceed & File Report
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


This is:

explicit

accessible

reusable

honest

2️⃣ HOW TO USE IT (example: SignaturePanel)
function SignaturePanel() {
  const { setCapabilities, setDegradedReports } = useNdaContext();

  const cameraUnavailable = /* detected failure */;

  if (cameraUnavailable) {
    return (
      <DegradedFeatureNotice
        featureName="Camera Signature"
        description="Camera access failed or was denied. You may continue using a typed signature."
        onProceed={() => {
          setCapabilities((c) => ({
            ...c,
            camera: "unavailable",
          }));
        }}
        onReport={() => {
          setCapabilities((c) => ({
            ...c,
            camera: "unavailable",
          }));

          setDegradedReports((r) => [
            ...r,
            {
              feature: "camera",
              reason: "permission_denied",
              timestamp: Date.now(),
            },
          ]);
        }}
      />
    );
  }

  return <ActualSignatureCanvas />;
}


Key points:

No blocking

User chooses explicitly

Context records the decision

UI remains usable

3️⃣ SUBMISSION LOGIC (central, safe)

Your submit button should:

✅ Allow submit if REQUIRED conditions are met
📝 Attach degraded feature reports if present
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  if (!canSubmitRequiredFields) return;

  await submitNda({
    formData,
    signature,
    degradedFeatures: degradedReports,
  });
};


This creates:

a legally valid NDA

a technical audit trail

zero user dead ends

4️⃣ NOTIFICATION (server-side)

On the backend, when a submission includes degradedFeatures:

Example payload
{
  "degradedFeatures": [
    {
      "feature": "camera",
      "reason": "permission_denied",
      "timestamp": 1710000000000
    }
  ]
}

Trigger a notification (email / Slack / queue)
if (degradedFeatures?.length) {
  await notifyOps({
    type: "DEGRADED_SUBMISSION",
    userId,
    page: "affiliate-nda",
    degradedFeatures,
  });
}


This is ops visibility, not user punishment.

5️⃣ USER COPY (important)

Use calm, non-alarming language.

Good:

“You may continue”

“We’ll review if needed”

“This won’t stop your submission”

Avoid:

“Error”

“Blocked”

“Required fix”

You’re building trust, not fear.

6️⃣ WHY THIS IS SAFE (legally & operationally)

User intent is explicit

Failure is acknowledged

Proceeding is logged

Core legal artifact is intact

Optional evidence is marked unavailable, not missing

This is stronger than silently failing or blocking.

7️⃣ THIS BECOMES A PLATFORM STANDARD

Once you have this component:

reuse it everywhere

camera

uploads

previews

integrations

AI helpers

Every failure looks and behaves the same.

🔒 ONE RULE TO ENFORCE

No optional feature may block submission without an explicit user choice and a logged reason.

You now have the UI and logic to enforce that rule.
