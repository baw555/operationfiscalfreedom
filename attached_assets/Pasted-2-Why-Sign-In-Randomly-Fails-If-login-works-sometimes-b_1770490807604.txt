2. Why Sign-In "Randomly" Fails
If login works sometimes but not others, it’s usually one of these three technical "ghosts":

The "Iframe/SameSite" Cookie Issue (Most Common): Replit displays your site inside an iframe in the editor. Modern browsers (Chrome/Safari) often block cookies inside iframes for security.

The Fix: In your Flask/Node config, you must set your cookies to SameSite=None and Secure=True. If you don't, the browser throws away your login session because it thinks it’s a "cross-site" attack.

The "Kill 1" Restart: On Replit’s free or basic tier, your server "sleeps" if no one is looking at it. When a new user hits the site, it wakes up. If your login system uses In-Memory Sessions (instead of a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL), every time the Repl sleeps, it forgets everyone who was logged in.

The Fix: Ensure you are saving session data to a database, not just the server's RAM.

Multiple Auth Systems (The "Agent" Bug): If you used the Replit Agent to "fix" things, it often creates a new login system instead of fixing the old one. You might have two different pieces of code trying to handle logins, and they are fighting each other.

3. "Functionality Breaks All The Time"
If things break right after you "fixed" them, you are likely dealing with Version Drift or Dependency Issues.

The "Secrets" Audit: Check your Secrets (Environment Variables) tab. If a key is missing or formatted wrong, the code will run fine in your editor but fail when a real user tries to trigger an API (like your "Operator AI").

Log Monitoring: Next time it "breaks," don't touch the code. Immediately open the "Logs" or "Console" tab in Replit. Look for:

500 Internal Server Error (Logic bug)

429 Too Many Requests (Replit is rate-limiting you)

OOM (Out of Memory) (Your Repl is running out of RAM)

Immediate Recommendation:
Check your Cookies: If you use Flask, add SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE='None' and SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True to your app.config.

Monitor with UptimeRobot: Set up a free account at UptimeRobot. It will ping your site every 5 minutes. If the site "breaks randomly," it will email you the exact second it happened so you can check the logs for that timestamp.

Audit the Agent: If you use the Replit Agent, ask it: "Show me every file that handles authentication. Are there duplicates?"
