Here is the exact thing to say to Replit to force a real, comprehensive test, not a surface-level “looks fine” response.

This is the strongest possible prompt you can give them.
Copy–paste it verbatim. Do not shorten it.

🔥 COMPREHENSIVE TEST PROMPT (COPY–PASTE TO REPLIT)

Perform a full, comprehensive, production-grade test of this entire application.

Assume the system is already broken in subtle ways even if it appears stable.
Your job is to prove correctness, not assume it.

1️⃣ EXECUTE REAL USER FLOWS (REQUIRED)

Manually and programmatically test every critical user flow, end-to-end:

Home page load

Navigation across all routes

Authentication (sign in, sign out, session persistence)

Scheduling (calendar render, interaction, booking, loading state resolution)

Contract signing (drawn + typed signature):

signature capture

submit button enablement

backend persistence

success confirmation

Chat widget (T.A.S.E.R. B.E.L.L.)

Repair / ticket submission

Email delivery triggers

For each flow:

State what should happen

State what actually happens

Identify where state can get stuck or silently fail

2️⃣ TEST FAILURE MODES (DO NOT SKIP)

Intentionally break things and report results:

Disable external scripts (calendar, embeds)

Delay network responses

Block third-party resources

Simulate slow mobile devices

Resize / rotate mobile viewports

Identify:

Infinite loading states

UI that renders but does not function

Missing fallback behavior

3️⃣ DEVICE & BROWSER MATRIX (MANDATORY)

Test on:

Desktop Chrome

Android Chrome

iOS Safari

Explicitly check:

Layout integrity

Touch interactions

Canvas / video elements

Keyboard + viewport resizing

4️⃣ VERIFY STATE & EVENT HANDLERS

Identify:

Event handlers that never fire

State transitions that are assumed but not verified

Optimistic UI that does not confirm backend success

Promises that resolve without updating UI

5️⃣ LOGIC & CODE AUDIT

Find and report:

Redundant or overlapping logic

Dead code paths

Feature flags or debug logic still affecting runtime

Recently added code that invalidates older logic

6️⃣ PERFORMANCE & STABILITY

Check for:

Excessive DOM scanning

Unbounded listeners or observers

Expensive client-side loops

Anything that could degrade over time

7️⃣ SECURITY & COMPLIANCE SANITY CHECK

Verify:

No sensitive data logged client-side

No credentials exposed

Consent / disclaimer flows enforced where required

8️⃣ OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)

Your response MUST include:

🔴 Confirmed Broken Behavior (with evidence)

🟠 Silent or Likely Failures

📁 Files & Functions Involved

🛠 Specific Fixes Required

🧪 Tests That Must Be Added

If any section is empty, explain why.

Do NOT say “everything is fine” without execution evidence.
Assume this is production-critical and revenue-impacting.
