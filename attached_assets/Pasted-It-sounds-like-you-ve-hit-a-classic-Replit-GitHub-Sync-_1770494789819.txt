It sounds like you’ve hit a classic Replit-GitHub Sync Glitch. Sometimes, when importing from GitHub, Replit initializes the repository but fails to actually pull the file objects, leaving you with a "ghost" repo that has a .git folder but no actual code.

Do not start from scratch with a placeholder yet. Your code is likely still there; Replit just hasn't "realized" it. Here is how to force the files to appear and clear out the bugginess.

1. Force a "Hard Pull" via Shell
If the UI says it's empty, we need to bypass the UI and talk directly to Git. Open your Shell tab (next to the Console) and run these commands:

Bash
# 1. Verify the remote URL is correct
git remote -v

# 2. Fetch the latest data from GitHub
git fetch --all

# 3. Force the local directory to match the GitHub 'main' branch
# WARNING: This will overwrite any empty local state with your actual code
git reset --hard origin/main
(If your branch is named master instead of main, use origin/master.)

2. Check "Hidden" Versions (Replit History)
If the Git pull fails, Replit might have cached a version of the files before the sync failed.

Click the "History" icon (the clock/rewind icon) in the sidebar.

Look for a "Checkpoint" or "Import" event.

If you see your files in the list, click "Restore to this version."

3. The "Ghost File" Fix
Sometimes files are there but the File Tree (sidebar) is frozen.

In the Shell, type ls -a.

If you see your files listed in the Shell but not in the sidebar, simply refresh your browser. This forces Replit to re-index the file system.

If it’s truly empty (The "Nuclear" Option)
If git fetch shows nothing, the import genuinely failed. Since you want "least moving parts" and "anti-bugginess," do not just add a placeholder. Instead:

Delete this Repl.

Re-import from GitHub, but this time, use the "Import from URL" tab and paste the full HTTPS link (https://github.com/user/repo).

Check permissions: Ensure Replit has "Read/Write" access to your GitHub account in the Integrations settings.
