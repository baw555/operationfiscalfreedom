benefits 
A widow (or widower) may be eligible for U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) survivor benefits if certain conditions are met. Here’s a clear breakdown of how a widow can receive VA benefits, what types exist, and the basic eligibility requirements.

This is the most important VA benefit for surviving spouses.

5 years from discharge to death, or
1 year if the veteran was a former POW
Marriage requirements
Married to the veteran:
Before or during service, or
At least 1 year before death, or
Had a child together
The widow has not remarried before age 57
(Remarriage after 57 may still allow DIC)

What are the common reasons a claim is denied 
VA survivor claims are often denied for technical or evidence-related reasons, not because the widow truly isn’t eligible. Below are the most common reasons VA denies a surviving spouse’s claim, especially for DIC and Survivors Pension—and what usually fixes them.
1. Death Not Proven Service-Connected (DIC claims)
Most common denial reason
VA may say:

The veteran’s death was not caused by a service-connected condition
The condition causing death was never service-connected
No medical “nexus” linking service → condition → death
Common fix
Medical opinion linking cause of death to service
Evidence of presumptive conditions (Agent Orange, burn pits, Gulf War, etc.)
Prior VA rating decisions or medical records
2. Veteran Didn’t Meet 100% Disability Time Requirement
VA denies DIC if:
Veteran was not rated 100% disabled long enough
VA does not count TDIU unless it was permanent
Common fix
Prove the veteran should have been rated 100% earlier
File a Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE) claim if VA made a rating mistake
