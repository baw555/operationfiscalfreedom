## Blocking Issues for Class Object Extraction

1. **5 entities lack a single source of truth**
2. **5 entities have fragmented lifecycle logic**
3. **4 entities are NOT feasible for class extraction today**
4. **4 disconnected identity systems** with no FK relationships between them
5. **52+ missing FK constraints** prevent safe relationship traversal
6. **Business logic embedded in route handlers** (commission calc, AI chat, email templates)
7. **Express `req` object passed to domain functions** (legal system coupling)

---

## Feasibility Conclusion

**Class objects are NOT feasible today for 4 out of 8 entities.**

**Extraction-ready entities:**
- **Claim Case** — Most feasible entity. Single ownership model, complete FK chain, atomic creation. Needs ownership guard centralization and 2 FK fixes.
- **Sailor Man AI Assistant** — Simplest candidate. 3 tables, clean FK chain, extracted service layer, no identity conflicts, no polymorphic references.

**Partially feasible entities:**
- **Legal Documents (NDA, Contracts, Signatures)** — Could create LegalDocument class IF all signatures unified, polymorphic affiliate_id resolved, and signLegalDocumentAtomic decoupled from Express req.
- **AI Session / Generation** — Could create AiSession class IF memory tables unified, chat orchestration extracted, identity resolved between users and ai_users.

**No fixes proposed. No refactoring performed. Assessment only.**
